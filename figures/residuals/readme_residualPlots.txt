The file name for each image only includes the first covariate in the model, which is sex.

All activity variables except act4* and act1* were modeled using the following covariates.

change variables (sc*) included these covariates as well:

        sex, batch, gen, cpp.box

Activity variables for day 4 (act4*) were modeled using:

        sex, cpp.box (there was no effect of gen or batch)

Activity on day 1 (act1*) was modeled using:

        sex, cpp.box, batch

PPI variables, startle and habituation included:

        sex, ppi.box, batch
