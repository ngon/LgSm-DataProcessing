Evaluating output of haplotype caller

SNPs only
Exclude indels with GATK-SelectVariants

Venn Diagrams of sites covered by various resources.
- SNPs in Lawson vs. Cheverud: they should not be very different. It would be interesting if they
  were. In that case the known SNP file should be the Intersection of the 2 sets
- If concordant as expected, use Union(Lawson + Cheverud + MUGA) as KNOWN

- KNOWN vs. GBS
- For all subsets: check sex.
    - subset I[nbred]: LG and SM samples from GBS and LAWSON BAMS, F1 from GBS
        * Concordance between LG/LG, SM/SM, and F1/F1 GBS files (there are 2 biological reps for
          each genetic background)
            > % homozygous sites in F1s, % heterozygous sites in LG and SM
        * Concordance between KNOWN and LAWSON BAMS, LAWSON BAMS and Subset I
            > Running HaplotypeCaller on LAWSON BAMS to see how its genotype calls match up to
              the ones filtered and considered True by HL. This could be useful as a sanity check
              for recalibrating variants. If the KNOWN set is used as the truth set, most of these
              calls should pass. HL's paper will have a tally of how many SNPs were filtered out of
              the original BAMs, which will be useful. I can use her KNOWN SNPs as the truth set
              for recalibrating bases with BQSR and then run those samples through the same process
              as the GBS BAMs.
    - subset A[ils genotyped on MUGA]: comparison of GBS and MUGA data
        * Overall coverage distribution at sites overlapping with KNOWN variants
        * Overall coverage distribution at sites not overlapping with KNOWN variants.
        * PerSample: % concordant genotypes between sites covered by both GBS and MUGA
        * PerSample: total DP (and DP at each allele if heterozygous) at each site
        * PerSample: DP by quality score at each site
        * PerSample: % heterozygous, hom-ref, and hom-alt sites
        * PerSite: average depth and quality score
        * PerSite: average heterozygosity
        * PerSibPair: compare genetic kinship between sibs within and between genotyping platforms
            > i.e. Sib1,2-MUGA, Sib1,2-GBS, Sib1-GBS,Sib2-MUGA, Sib1-MUGA,Sib2-GBS
            > kinship coefficient and %IBS(0) SNPs
            > also compare kinship and IBS(0) for a few unrelated pairs
    - subset F[amily of AILs from F39-43]: GBS
        * Overall coverage distribution at sites overlapping with KNOWN variants
        * Overall coverage distribution at sites not overlapping with KNOWN variants.
        * PerSample: total DP (and DP at each allele if heterozygous) at each site
        * PerSample: DP by quality score at each site
        * PerSample: % heterozygous, hom-ref, and hom-alt sites
        * PerSite: average depth and quality score
        * PerSite: average heterozygosity
        * Make a small pedigree file (it has to include all samples in the gVCF)
        * Mendelian error checking with GATK
            > % variants violating Mendelian expectations
            > it is possible to check for de Novo variants - could be useful to see how this
              function is working and in a few cases could provide additional evidence for
              discovery calls.
        * PhaseByTransmission
        * Theoretical vs. Realized Kinship
        * Annotate these sites with Inbreeding Coefficient

Error analysis
- What is the read depth?
- What is the average base quality?
- What is the Ts/Tv ratio?
- What is the nucleotide context?
- e.g. for...
    * sites where more than 2 alternative alleles are acknowledged (see NDA field - these are
      present but not necessarily called
    * Mendelian errors identified from Subset F
    * discordant SNPs identified from Subsets I and A
