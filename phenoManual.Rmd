# I. Phenotypes Summary

## A. CPP and Activity

Data is measured in six 5-min (300 sec) bins over the course of 8 days.  
No measurements are taken on days 6-7.
For variables measured on multiple days, the variable name is structured as
"nameN.n" where 'N' represents the day (1-5 & 8) and 'n' represents the bin. 


### 1. CPP
* cppN.n - time spent on left(meth)-paired side on day 1 or 8 (initial preference)
* cppN.p - proportion of time spent on left(meth)-paired side on day 1 or 8 (cpp)
* cppN.t - total sec spend on left(meth)-paired side on day 1 or 8 (cpp)
* cpp.diff - cpp8.p minus cpp1.p
* cpp.diff.corrected - cpp.diff with corrected proportions for animals with comerr1 or 8


### 2. Activity
* actN.n - cm traveled on day N, bin n
* actN.t - cm traveled on day N, total
* scN.n - number times the mouse switched from L to R side, day 1 or 8, bin n
* scN.t - number times the mouse switched from L to R side, day 1 or 8, total
* sens - locomotor sensitization, act4.t minus act2.t


### 3. Wildness
* wild - number of times the mouse escaped its holding cage during the cpp assay


## B. PPI

### 1. PPI
* avg.ppi - average ppi over all 3 prepulse trials
* ppi3 - average ppi for trials with 73 dB prepulse
* ppi6 - average ppi for trials with 76 dB prepulse
* ppi12 - average ppi for trials with 82 dB prepulse

### 2. Startle
* startle 

### 3. Habituation
* habituation


## C. Physiological phenotypes

### 1. Fasting blood glucose
* glucose - blood glucose levels after a 4-hr fast (09:00 - 13:00)

### 2. Body weight
* dN.weight - weight on day N of the cpp assay
* ppi.weight - weight on day ppi was measured
* glu.weight - weight on day glucose levels were taken
* rip.weight - post mortem weight

### 3. Tail length
* tail - cm



# Covariates

1. Age (days)
* cpp.age
* ppi.age
* glu.age
* rip.age - age at death
* wean.age - age when animal was weaned (should be ~21d)

2. Dates (POSIXlt "%m/%d/%y")
* cpp.date 
* ppi.date
* glu.date
* rip.date
* dob - date of birth

3. Box (number)
* cpp.box
* ppi.box

4. Family
* fam - family name with structure 'Br''gen of parents'-'nn' (e.g. BrF54-09)
* dam - mom's 5 digit id
* sire - dad's 5 digit id
* cage - mouse's house with structure 'Test''gen'-'nn' (e.g. TestF50-01)
* mf.ratio - ratio of males to females in litter

5. Batch info
* batch - number
* gen - generation 

6. Coat 
* cc - coat color (AG, W, B) and ear tag location (L, R, RL)

7. Sex
* sex - M or F
