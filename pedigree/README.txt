        /genotypedRelatives.RData : two lists. elements in 'fams' are numbered arbitrarily. each
                    element contains, at the very least, a trio (offspring listed first, sire and
                    dam are the last 2 entries, respectively). for some families, multiple sibs 
                    were genotyped. all animals in 'fams' are F39-43 AILs.
                    elements in 'sibPairs' are genotyped brother-sister pairs from F50-56.
